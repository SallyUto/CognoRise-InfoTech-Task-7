### Data Scientist Salaries/Job Role Analysis

## Project Description
Data science is a rapidly growing field, and Data Scientists play a crucial role in analyzing and interpreting large volumes of data. As this profession becomes increasingly in demand, it is important to understand the factors that may influence Data Scientists’ salaries. This analysis focuses on investigating these factors and their impact on salaries. 

To achieve this, a dataset of Salaries of different Data Science Fields in the Data Science Domain containing various relevant variables was utilized. This report describes the exploratory analysis conducted to understand the relationship between these factors and Data Scientists’ salaries. 

## Variables In DataSet
Work_year: The year the salary was paid. 
Experience_level: The experience level in the job during the year. 
EN > Entry-level / Junior 
MI > Mid-level / Intermediate 
SE > Senior-level / Expert 
EX > Executive-level / Director 
Employment_type: The type of employment for the role. 
PT > Part-time 
FT > Full-time 
CT > Contract 
FL > Freelance 
Job_title: The role worked in during the year. salary: The total gross salary amount paid.

Employee_residence: Employee's primary country of residence during the work year as an ISO 3166 country code. 
Remote_ratio: The overall amount of work done remotely. 
Company_location: The country of the employer's main office or contracting branch. 
Company_size: The median number of people that worked for the company during the year. 

## Project Objectives
1. Analyze salary trends across different Data Science Fields in the Data Science Domain. Using these variables, job tittles, experience levels and employment types.
2. Investigate the impact of remote work ratio across different variables as job tittles, work year and employee residence.
3. Distribution of company location matrix across variables such as job tittles, experience level, country salary, salary in USD, remote ratio and number of employees.

## Key Insights
1. Top Paying Job Role: Data Engineers lead with an average of salary of over $148k.
2.  Experience Level: Senior Staff, who are in full-time employment type, have the highest pay.
3.  Remote Work Ratio Trend: Employees in the US have the higher remote work ratio than other countries, especially in the year 2022. And also the US has the higher rate of number of employees.
4. Geographical Analysis: Employees based in the US receive the highest salaries on average.
5. Company Size Analysis: The Medium size of company lead in population of the total number of employees, having the Full-Time staff as the highest.
